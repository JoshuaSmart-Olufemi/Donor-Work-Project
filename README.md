# Donor-Work-Project
You have been hired to deliver actionable insight to support your client who is a national charitable  organization. The client seeks to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to  improve outcome in the next campaign. You want to determine which of the individuals in their mailing  database have characteristics similar to those of your most profitable donors. By soliciting only these  people, your client can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable  concerns.  You have been provided two data sets: A. Donor Raw Data: this is a historical data, containing previous donor details. Target B column,  provides information whether they have donated in past campaign or not. B. Prospective Donors: this is a list of new contact; your client is interested in reaching out to in  the next campaign they intend to carry out soon. You are required to deliver a ten-page PowerPoint presentation of your actionable recommendation  to help the client identify which prospects they should focus their next campaign on.
